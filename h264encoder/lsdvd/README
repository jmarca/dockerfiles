lsdvd is a program that reads information about a DVD and outputs it
to the console in various formats: human-readable, perl, python, ruby
and XML.

Run 'lsdvd --help' to see options.

The only required library is libvdread.

To install from the git source, you will need autools installed
to run autoreconf:

  $ autoreconf -fi

To build the source after this, or when using the source tarball,
run these commands:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

See https://sourceforge.net/projects/lsdvd/ for documentation, to report
bugs, follow progress in git, and follow the development mailing list.
Patches, feedback and bug reports about DVDs are welcome!
